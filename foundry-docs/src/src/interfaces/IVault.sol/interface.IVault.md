Core interface for retail staking operations enabling kToken holders to earn yield through vault strategies

*This interface defines the primary user entry points for the KAM protocol's retail staking system. Vaults
implementing this interface provide a gateway for individual kToken holders to participate in yield generation
alongside institutional flows. The system operates on a dual-token model: (1) Users deposit kTokens (1:1 backed
tokens) and receive stkTokens (share tokens) that accrue yield, (2) Batch processing aggregates multiple user
operations for gas efficiency and fair pricing, (3) Two-phase operations (request â†’ claim) enable optimal
settlement coordination with the broader protocol. Key features include: asset flow coordination with kAssetRouter
for virtual balance management, integration with DN vaults for yield source diversification, batch settlement
system for gas-efficient operations, and automated yield distribution through share price appreciation rather
than token rebasing. This approach maintains compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure while providing
transparent yield accrual for retail participants.*


## Functions
### requestStake

Initiates kToken staking request for yield-generating stkToken shares in a batch processing system

*This function begins the retail staking process by: (1) Validating user has sufficient kToken balance
and vault is not paused, (2) Creating a pending stake request with user-specified recipient and current
batch ID for fair settlement, (3) Transferring kTokens from user to vault while updating pending stake
tracking for accurate share calculations, (4) Coordinating with kAssetRouter to virtually move underlying
assets from DN vault to staking vault, enabling proper asset allocation across the protocol. The request
enters pending state until batch settlement, when the final share price is calculated based on vault
performance. Users must later call claimStakedShares() after settlement to receive their stkTokens at
the settled price. This two-phase approach ensures fair pricing for all users within a batch period.*


```solidity
function requestStake(address to, uint256 kTokensAmount) external payable returns (bytes32 requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to`|`address`|The recipient address that will receive the stkTokens after successful settlement and claiming|
|`kTokensAmount`|`uint256`|The quantity of kTokens to stake (must not exceed user balance, cannot be zero)|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|Unique identifier for tracking this staking request through settlement and claiming|


### requestUnstake

Initiates stkToken unstaking request for kToken redemption plus accrued yield through batch processing

*This function begins the retail unstaking process by: (1) Validating user has sufficient stkToken balance
and vault is operational, (2) Creating pending unstake request with current batch ID for settlement
coordination,
(3) Transferring stkTokens from user to vault contract to maintain stable share price during settlement period,
(4) Notifying kAssetRouter of share redemption request for proper accounting across vault network. The stkTokens
remain locked in the vault until settlement when they are burned and equivalent kTokens (including yield) are
made available. Users must later call claimUnstakedAssets() after settlement to receive their kTokens from
the batch receiver contract. This two-phase design ensures accurate yield calculations and prevents share
price manipulation during the settlement process.*


```solidity
function requestUnstake(address to, uint256 stkTokenAmount) external payable returns (bytes32 requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to`|`address`|The recipient address that will receive the kTokens after successful settlement and claiming|
|`stkTokenAmount`|`uint256`|The quantity of stkTokens to unstake (must not exceed user balance, cannot be zero)|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|Unique identifier for tracking this unstaking request through settlement and claiming|


### cancelStakeRequest

Cancels a pending stake request and returns kTokens to the user before batch settlement

*This function allows users to reverse their staking request before batch processing by: (1) Validating
the request exists, belongs to the caller, and remains in pending status, (2) Checking the associated batch
hasn't been closed or settled to prevent manipulation of finalized operations, (3) Updating request status
to cancelled and removing from user's active requests tracking, (4) Reducing total pending stake amount
to maintain accurate vault accounting, (5) Notifying kAssetRouter to reverse the virtual asset movement
from staking vault back to DN vault, ensuring proper asset allocation, (6) Returning the originally deposited
kTokens to the user's address. This cancellation mechanism provides flexibility for users who change their
mind or need immediate liquidity before the batch settlement occurs. The operation is only valid during
the open batch period before closure by relayers.*


```solidity
function cancelStakeRequest(bytes32 requestId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|The unique identifier of the stake request to cancel (must be owned by caller)|


### cancelUnstakeRequest

Cancels a pending unstake request and returns stkTokens to the user before batch settlement

*This function allows users to reverse their unstaking request before batch processing by: (1) Validating
the request exists, belongs to the caller, and remains in pending status, (2) Checking the associated batch
hasn't been closed or settled to prevent reversal of finalized operations, (3) Updating request status
to cancelled and removing from user's active requests tracking, (4) Notifying kAssetRouter to reverse the
share redemption request, maintaining proper share accounting across the protocol, (5) Returning the originally
transferred stkTokens from the vault back to the user's address. This cancellation mechanism enables users
to maintain their staked position if market conditions change or they reconsider their unstaking decision.
The stkTokens are returned without any yield impact since the batch hasn't settled. The operation is only
valid during the open batch period before closure by relayers.*


```solidity
function cancelUnstakeRequest(bytes32 requestId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|The unique identifier of the unstake request to cancel (must be owned by caller)|


### setPaused

Controls the vault's operational state for emergency situations and maintenance periods

*This function provides critical safety controls for vault operations by: (1) Enabling emergency admins
to pause all user-facing operations during security incidents, market anomalies, or critical upgrades,
(2) Preventing new stake/unstake requests and claims while preserving existing vault state and user balances,
(3) Maintaining read-only access to vault data and view functions during pause periods for transparency,
(4) Allowing authorized emergency admins to resume operations once issues are resolved or maintenance completed.
When paused, all state-changing functions (requestStake, requestUnstake, cancelStakeRequest,
cancelUnstakeRequest,
claimStakedShares, claimUnstakedAssets) will revert with KSTAKINGVAULT_IS_PAUSED error. The pause mechanism
serves as a circuit breaker protecting user funds during unexpected events while maintaining protocol integrity.
Only emergency admins have permission to toggle this state, ensuring rapid response capabilities during critical
situations without compromising decentralization principles.*


```solidity
function setPaused(bool paused_) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`paused_`|`bool`|The desired operational state (true = pause operations, false = resume operations)|
