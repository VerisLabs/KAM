# IVaultFees
[Git Source](https://github.com/VerisLabs/KAM/blob/7810ef786f844ebd78831ee424b7ee896113d92b/src/interfaces/IVaultFees.sol)

Interface for vault fee management including performance and management fees with hurdle rate mechanisms

*This interface defines the fee structure for staking vaults, implementing traditional fund management fee
models adapted for DeFi yield generation. The system supports two primary fee types: (1) Management Fees: Charged
periodically on assets under management regardless of performance, compensating vault operators for operational
costs and risk management, (2) Performance Fees: Charged on excess returns above hurdle rates, aligning operator
incentives with user returns. The hurdle rate mechanism can operate in two modes: soft hurdle (fees on all profits)
or hard hurdle (fees only on excess above hurdle). Fee calculations integrate with the batch settlement system,
ensuring accurate deductions from user returns during share price calculations. Backend coordination allows for
off-chain fee processing with on-chain validation and tracking. All fees are expressed in basis points (1% = 100 bp)
for precision and standard financial terminology alignment.*


## Functions
### setHardHurdleRate

Configures the hurdle rate fee calculation mechanism for performance fee determination

*This function switches between soft and hard hurdle rate modes affecting performance fee calculations.
Hurdle Rate Modes: (1) Soft Hurdle (_isHard = false): Performance fees are charged on all profits when returns
exceed the hurdle rate threshold, providing simpler fee calculation while maintaining performance incentives,
(2) Hard Hurdle (_isHard = true): Performance fees are only charged on the excess return above the hurdle rate,
ensuring users keep the full hurdle rate return before any performance fees. The hurdle rate itself is set
globally in the registry per asset, providing consistent benchmarks across vaults. This mechanism ensures
vault operators are only rewarded for generating returns above market expectations, protecting user interests
while incentivizing superior performance.*


```solidity
function setHardHurdleRate(bool _isHard) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_isHard`|`bool`|True for hard hurdle (fees only on excess), false for soft hurdle (fees on all profits)|


### setManagementFee

Sets the annual management fee rate charged on assets under management

*This function configures the periodic fee charged regardless of vault performance, compensating operators
for ongoing vault management, risk monitoring, and operational costs. Management fees are calculated based on
time elapsed since last fee charge and total assets under management. Process: (1) Validates fee rate does not
exceed maximum allowed to protect users from excessive fees, (2) Updates stored management fee rate for future
calculations, (3) Emits event for transparency and off-chain tracking. The fee accrues continuously and is
realized during batch settlements, ensuring users see accurate net returns. Management fees are deducted from
vault assets before performance fee calculations, following traditional fund management practices.*


```solidity
function setManagementFee(uint16 _managementFee) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_managementFee`|`uint16`|Annual management fee rate in basis points (1% = 100 bp, max 10000 bp)|


### setPerformanceFee

Sets the performance fee rate charged on vault returns above hurdle rates

*This function configures the success fee charged when vault performance exceeds benchmark hurdle rates,
aligning operator incentives with user returns. Performance fees are calculated during settlement based on
share price appreciation above the watermark (highest previous share price) and hurdle rate requirements.
Process: (1) Validates fee rate is within acceptable bounds for user protection, (2) Updates performance fee
rate for future calculations, (3) Emits tracking event for transparency. The fee applies only to new high
watermarks, preventing double-charging on recovered losses. Combined with hurdle rates, this ensures operators
are rewarded for generating superior risk-adjusted returns while protecting users from excessive fee extraction.*


```solidity
function setPerformanceFee(uint16 _performanceFee) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_performanceFee`|`uint16`|Performance fee rate in basis points charged on excess returns (max 10000 bp)|


### notifyManagementFeesCharged

Updates the timestamp tracking for management fee calculations after backend fee processing

*This function maintains accurate management fee accrual by recording when fees were last processed.
Backend Coordination: (1) Off-chain systems calculate and process management fees based on time elapsed and
assets under management, (2) Fees are deducted from vault assets through settlement mechanisms, (3) This
function
updates the tracking timestamp to prevent double-charging in future calculations. The timestamp validation
ensures logical progression and prevents manipulation. Management fees accrue continuously, and proper timestamp
tracking is essential for accurate pro-rata fee calculations across all vault participants.*


```solidity
function notifyManagementFeesCharged(uint64 _timestamp) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_timestamp`|`uint64`|The timestamp when management fees were processed (must be >= last timestamp, <= current time)|


### notifyPerformanceFeesCharged

Updates the timestamp tracking for performance fee calculations after backend fee processing

*This function maintains accurate performance fee tracking by recording when performance fees were last
calculated and charged. Backend Processing: (1) Off-chain systems evaluate vault performance against watermarks
and hurdle rates, (2) Performance fees are calculated on excess returns and deducted during settlement,
(3) This notification updates tracking timestamp and potentially adjusts watermark levels. The timestamp ensures
proper sequencing of performance evaluations and prevents fee calculation errors. Performance fees are
event-driven
based on new high watermarks, making accurate timestamp tracking crucial for fair fee assessment across all
users.*


```solidity
function notifyPerformanceFeesCharged(uint64 _timestamp) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_timestamp`|`uint64`|The timestamp when performance fees were processed (must be >= last timestamp, <= current time)|
