Retail staking vault enabling kToken holders to earn yield through batch-processed share tokens

*This contract implements the complete retail staking system for the KAM protocol, providing individual
kToken holders access to institutional-grade yield opportunities through a share-based mechanism. The implementation
combines several architectural patterns: (1) Dual-token system where kTokens convert to yield-bearing stkTokens,
(2) Batch processing for gas-efficient operations and fair pricing across multiple users, (3) Virtual balance
coordination with kAssetRouter for cross-vault yield optimization, (4) Two-phase operations (request â†’ claim)
ensuring accurate settlement and preventing MEV attacks, (5) Fee management system supporting both management
and performance fees with hurdle rate mechanisms. The vault integrates with the broader protocol through
kAssetRouter for asset flow coordination and yield distribution. Gas optimizations include packed storage,
minimal proxy deployment for batch receivers, and efficient batch settlement processing. The modular architecture
enables upgrades while maintaining state integrity through UUPS pattern and ERC-7201 storage.*


## Functions
### constructor

Disables initializers to prevent implementation contract initialization


```solidity
constructor();
```

### initialize

Initializes the kStakingVault with complete protocol integration and share token configuration

*This function establishes the vault's integration with the KAM protocol ecosystem. The initialization
process: (1) Validates asset address to prevent deployment with invalid configuration, (2) Initializes
BaseVault foundation with registry and operational state, (3) Sets up ownership and access control through
Ownable pattern, (4) Configures share token metadata and decimals for ERC20 functionality, (5) Establishes
kToken integration through registry lookup for asset-to-token mapping, (6) Sets initial share price watermark
for performance fee calculations, (7) Deploys BatchReceiver implementation for settlement asset distribution.
The initialization creates a complete retail staking solution integrated with the protocol's institutional
flows.*


```solidity
function initialize(
    address owner_,
    address registry_,
    bool paused_,
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    uint8 decimals_,
    address asset_
)
    external
    initializer;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owner_`|`address`|The address that will have administrative control over the vault|
|`registry_`|`address`|The kRegistry contract address for protocol configuration integration|
|`paused_`|`bool`|Initial operational state (true = paused, false = active)|
|`name_`|`string`|ERC20 token name for the stkToken (e.g., "Staked kUSDC")|
|`symbol_`|`string`|ERC20 token symbol for the stkToken (e.g., "stkUSDC")|
|`decimals_`|`uint8`|Token decimals matching the underlying asset precision|
|`asset_`|`address`|Underlying asset address that this vault will generate yield on|


### requestStake

Initiates kToken staking request for yield-generating stkToken shares in a batch processing system

*This function begins the retail staking process by: (1) Validating user has sufficient kToken balance
and vault is not paused, (2) Creating a pending stake request with user-specified recipient and current
batch ID for fair settlement, (3) Transferring kTokens from user to vault while updating pending stake
tracking for accurate share calculations, (4) Coordinating with kAssetRouter to virtually move underlying
assets from DN vault to staking vault, enabling proper asset allocation across the protocol. The request
enters pending state until batch settlement, when the final share price is calculated based on vault
performance. Users must later call claimStakedShares() after settlement to receive their stkTokens at
the settled price. This two-phase approach ensures fair pricing for all users within a batch period.*


```solidity
function requestStake(address to, uint256 amount) external payable returns (bytes32 requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to`|`address`|The recipient address that will receive the stkTokens after successful settlement and claiming|
|`amount`|`uint256`||

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|Unique identifier for tracking this staking request through settlement and claiming|


### requestUnstake

Initiates stkToken unstaking request for kToken redemption plus accrued yield through batch processing

*This function begins the retail unstaking process by: (1) Validating user has sufficient stkToken balance
and vault is operational, (2) Creating pending unstake request with current batch ID for settlement
coordination,
(3) Transferring stkTokens from user to vault contract to maintain stable share price during settlement period,
(4) Notifying kAssetRouter of share redemption request for proper accounting across vault network. The stkTokens
remain locked in the vault until settlement when they are burned and equivalent kTokens (including yield) are
made available. Users must later call claimUnstakedAssets() after settlement to receive their kTokens from
the batch receiver contract. This two-phase design ensures accurate yield calculations and prevents share
price manipulation during the settlement process.*


```solidity
function requestUnstake(address to, uint256 stkTokenAmount) external payable returns (bytes32 requestId);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|

hasn't been closed or settled to prevent manipulation of finalized operations, (3) Updating request status
to cancelled and removing from user's active requests tracking, (4) Reducing total pending stake amount
to maintain accurate vault accounting, (5) Notifying kAssetRouter to reverse the virtual asset movement
from staking vault back to DN vault, ensuring proper asset allocation, (6) Returning the originally deposited
kTokens to the user's address. This cancellation mechanism provides flexibility for users who change their
mind or need immediate liquidity before the batch settlement occurs. The operation is only valid during
the open batch period before closure by relayers.*


```solidity
function cancelStakeRequest(bytes32 requestId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|The unique identifier of the stake request to cancel (must be owned by caller)|


### cancelUnstakeRequest

Cancels a pending unstake request and returns stkTokens to the user before batch settlement

*This function allows users to reverse their unstaking request before batch processing by: (1) Validating
the request exists, belongs to the caller, and remains in pending status, (2) Checking the associated batch
hasn't been closed or settled to prevent reversal of finalized operations, (3) Updating request status
to cancelled and removing from user's active requests tracking, (4) Notifying kAssetRouter to reverse the
share redemption request, maintaining proper share accounting across the protocol, (5) Returning the originally
transferred stkTokens from the vault back to the user's address. This cancellation mechanism enables users
to maintain their staked position if market conditions change or they reconsider their unstaking decision.
The stkTokens are returned without any yield impact since the batch hasn't settled. The operation is only
valid during the open batch period before closure by relayers.*


```solidity
function cancelUnstakeRequest(bytes32 requestId) external payable;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`requestId`|`bytes32`|The unique identifier of the unstake request to cancel (must be owned by caller)|


### createNewBatch

Creates a new batch to begin aggregating user requests for the next settlement period

*This function initializes a fresh batch period for collecting staking and unstaking requests. Process:
(1) Increments internal batch counter for unique identification, (2) Generates deterministic batch ID using
chain-specific parameters (vault address, batch number, chainid, timestamp, asset) for collision resistance,
(3) Initializes batch storage with open state enabling new request acceptance, (4) Updates vault's current
batch tracking for request routing. Only relayers can call this function as part of the automated settlement
schedule. The timing is typically coordinated with institutional settlement cycles to optimize capital
efficiency
across the protocol. Each batch remains open until explicitly closed by relayers or governance.*


```solidity
function createNewBatch() external returns (bytes32);
```
**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`bytes32`|batchId Unique deterministic identifier for the newly created batch period|


### closeBatch

Closes a batch to prevent new requests and prepare for settlement processing

*This function transitions a batch from open to closed state, finalizing the request set for settlement.
Process: (1) Validates batch exists and is currently open to prevent double-closing, (2) Marks batch as closed
preventing new stake/unstake requests from joining, (3) Optionally creates new batch for continued operations
if _create flag is true, enabling seamless transitions. Once closed, the batch awaits settlement by kAssetRouter
which will calculate final share prices and distribute yields. Only relayers can execute batch closure as part
of the coordinated settlement schedule across all protocol vaults. The timing typically aligns with DN vault
yield calculations to ensure accurate price discovery.*


```solidity
function closeBatch(bytes32 _batchId, bool _create) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_batchId`|`bytes32`|The specific batch identifier to close (must be currently open)|
|`_create`|`bool`|Whether to immediately create a new batch after closing for continued operations|


### settleBatch

Marks a batch as settled after yield distribution and enables user claiming

*This function finalizes batch settlement by recording final asset values and enabling claims. Process:
(1) Validates batch is closed and not already settled to prevent duplicate processing, (2) Snapshots both
gross and net share prices at settlement time for accurate reward calculations, (3) Marks batch as settled
enabling users to claim their staked shares or unstaked assets, (4) Completes the batch lifecycle allowing
reward distribution through the claiming mechanism. Only kAssetRouter can settle batches as it coordinates
yield calculations across DN vaults and manages cross-vault asset flows. Settlement triggers share price
finalization based on vault performance during the batch period.*


```solidity
function settleBatch(bytes32 _batchId) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_batchId`|`bytes32`|The batch identifier to mark as settled (must be closed, not previously settled)|


### burnFees


```solidity
function burnFees(uint256 shares) external;
```

### _createNewBatch

Internal function to create deterministic batch IDs with collision resistance

*This function generates unique batch identifiers using multiple entropy sources for security. The ID
generation process: (1) Increments internal batch counter to ensure uniqueness within the vault, (2) Combines
vault address, batch number, chain ID, timestamp, and asset address for collision resistance, (3) Uses
optimized hashing function for gas efficiency, (4) Initializes batch storage with default state for new
requests. The deterministic approach enables consistent batch identification across different contexts while
the multiple entropy sources prevent prediction or collision attacks. Each batch starts in open state ready
to accept user requests until explicitly closed by relayers.*


```solidity

Hurdle Rate Modes: (1) Soft Hurdle (_isHard = false): Performance fees are charged on all profits when returns
exceed the hurdle rate threshold, providing simpler fee calculation while maintaining performance incentives,
(2) Hard Hurdle (_isHard = true): Performance fees are only charged on the excess return above the hurdle rate,
ensuring users keep the full hurdle rate return before any performance fees. The hurdle rate itself is set
globally in the registry per asset, providing consistent benchmarks across vaults. This mechanism ensures
vault operators are only rewarded for generating returns above market expectations, protecting user interests
while incentivizing superior performance.*


```solidity
function setHardHurdleRate(bool _isHard) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|

calculations, (3) Emits event for transparency and off-chain tracking. The fee accrues continuously and is
realized during batch settlements, ensuring users see accurate net returns. Management fees are deducted from
vault assets before performance fee calculations, following traditional fund management practices.*


```solidity
function setManagementFee(uint16 _managementFee) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_managementFee`|`uint16`|Annual management fee rate in basis points (1% = 100 bp, max 10000 bp)|


### setPerformanceFee

Sets the performance fee rate charged on vault returns above hurdle rates

*This function configures the success fee charged when vault performance exceeds benchmark hurdle rates,

Process: (1) Validates fee rate is within acceptable bounds for user protection, (2) Updates performance fee
rate for future calculations, (3) Emits tracking event for transparency. The fee applies only to new high
watermarks, preventing double-charging on recovered losses. Combined with hurdle rates, this ensures operators
are rewarded for generating superior risk-adjusted returns while protecting users from excessive fee extraction.*


```solidity
function setPerformanceFee(uint16 _performanceFee) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_performanceFee`|`uint16`|Performance fee rate in basis points charged on excess returns (max 10000 bp)|

function
updates the tracking timestamp to prevent double-charging in future calculations. The timestamp validation
ensures logical progression and prevents manipulation. Management fees accrue continuously, and proper timestamp
tracking is essential for accurate pro-rata fee calculations across all vault participants.*


```solidity
function notifyManagementFeesCharged(uint64 _timestamp) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_timestamp`|`uint64`|The timestamp when management fees were processed (must be >= last timestamp, <= current time)|


### notifyPerformanceFeesCharged

Updates the timestamp tracking for performance fee calculations after backend fee processing

*This function maintains accurate performance fee tracking by recording when performance fees were last
calculated and charged. Backend Processing: (1) Off-chain systems evaluate vault performance against watermarks
and hurdle rates, (2) Performance fees are calculated on excess returns and deducted during settlement,
(3) This notification updates tracking timestamp and potentially adjusts watermark levels. The timestamp ensures
proper sequencing of performance evaluations and prevents fee calculation errors. Performance fees are
event-driven
based on new high watermarks, making accurate timestamp tracking crucial for fair fee assessment across all
users.*


```solidity
function notifyPerformanceFeesCharged(uint64 _timestamp) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`_timestamp`|`uint64`|The timestamp when performance fees were processed (must be >= last timestamp, <= current time)|


### _updateGlobalWatermark

*This function provides critical safety controls for vault operations by: (1) Enabling emergency admins
to pause all user-facing operations during security incidents, market anomalies, or critical upgrades,
(2) Preventing new stake/unstake requests and claims while preserving existing vault state and user balances,
(3) Maintaining read-only access to vault data and view functions during pause periods for transparency,
(4) Allowing authorized emergency admins to resume operations once issues are resolved or maintenance completed.
When paused, all state-changing functions (requestStake, requestUnstake, cancelStakeRequest,
cancelUnstakeRequest,
claimStakedShares, claimUnstakedAssets) will revert with KSTAKINGVAULT_IS_PAUSED error. The pause mechanism
serves as a circuit breaker protecting user funds during unexpected events while maintaining protocol integrity.
Only emergency admins have permission to toggle this state, ensuring rapid response capabilities during critical
situations without compromising decentralization principles.*
