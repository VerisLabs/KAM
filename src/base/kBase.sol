/// @title kBase
/// @notice Foundation contract providing essential shared functionality and registry integration for all KAM protocol
/// contracts
/// @dev This abstract contract serves as the architectural foundation for the entire KAM protocol, establishing
/// critical patterns and utilities that ensure consistency across all protocol components. Key responsibilities
/// include: (1) Registry integration through a singleton pattern that enables dynamic protocol configuration and
/// contract discovery, (2) Role-based access control validation that enforces protocol governance permissions,
/// (3) Emergency pause functionality for protocol-wide risk mitigation during critical events, (4) Asset rescue
/// mechanisms to recover stuck funds while protecting protocol assets, (5) Vault and asset validation to ensure
/// only registered components interact, (6) Batch processing coordination through ID management and receiver tracking.
/// The contract employs ERC-7201 namespaced storage to prevent storage collisions during upgrades and enable safe
/// inheritance patterns. All inheriting contracts (kMinter, kAssetRouter, etc.) leverage these utilities to maintain
/// protocol integrity, reduce code duplication, and ensure consistent security checks across the ecosystem. The
/// registry serves as the single source of truth for protocol configuration, making the system highly modular and
/// upgradeable.
