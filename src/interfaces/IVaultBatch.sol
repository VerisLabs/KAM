/// @notice Interface for batch lifecycle management enabling gas-efficient settlement of multiple user operations
/// @dev This interface defines the batch processing system that aggregates individual staking/unstaking requests
/// for efficient settlement. The batch lifecycle consists of three distinct phases: (1) Open Phase: New requests
/// can be added to the current batch, enabling users to join the settlement period, (2) Closed Phase: No new
/// requests accepted, batch is prepared for settlement with final share price calculations, (3) Settled Phase:
/// Assets distributed and share prices fixed, users can claim their rewards/redemptions. This system provides
/// several key benefits: gas cost optimization through bulk processing, fair pricing through synchronized settlement,
/// coordination with kAssetRouter for cross-vault yield distribution, and minimal proxy deployment for isolated
/// asset distribution. The batch system is critical for maintaining protocol scalability while ensuring equitable
/// treatment of all participants within each settlement period.
