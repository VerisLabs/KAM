/// @notice Interface for claiming settled staking rewards and unstaking assets after batch processing completion
/// @dev This interface defines the final phase of the two-phase staking/unstaking system where users collect
/// their rewards after batch settlement. The claiming mechanism operates after batches have been settled by
/// kAssetRouter with finalized share prices and yield calculations. Key features include: (1) Share Distribution:
/// For staking claims, users receive stkTokens at the settled share price reflecting vault performance during
/// the batch period, (2) Asset Distribution: For unstaking claims, users receive kTokens (including accrued yield)
/// distributed through batch-specific receiver contracts, (3) Request Validation: Claims are validated against
/// original requests to ensure only authorized recipients can claim, (4) State Management: Claimed requests are
/// marked to prevent double-claiming while maintaining audit trails. The two-phase approach (request â†’ claim)
/// provides several advantages: fair pricing through synchronized settlement, gas efficiency by separating request
/// processing from asset distribution, security through settled price finalization, and operational flexibility
/// for users to claim rewards at their convenience after settlement.
