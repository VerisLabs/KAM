/// @notice Interface for minimal proxy contracts that manage asset distribution for completed batch redemptions
/// @dev kBatchReceiver contracts are deployed as minimal proxies (one per batch) to efficiently manage the distribution
/// of settled assets to users who requested redemptions. This design pattern provides: (1) gas-efficient deployment
/// since each batch gets its own isolated distribution contract, (2) clear asset segregation preventing cross-batch
/// contamination, (3) simplified accounting where each receiver holds exactly the assets needed for one batch.
/// The contract serves as a temporary holding mechanism - kMinter transfers settled assets to the receiver, then users
/// can pull their proportional share. This architecture ensures fair distribution and prevents front-running during
/// the redemption settlement process. Only the originating kMinter contract can interact with receivers, maintaining
/// strict access control throughout the asset distribution phase.
