/// @notice Interface for vault fee management including performance and management fees with hurdle rate mechanisms
/// @dev This interface defines the fee structure for staking vaults, implementing traditional fund management fee
/// models adapted for DeFi yield generation. The system supports two primary fee types: (1) Management Fees: Charged
/// periodically on assets under management regardless of performance, compensating vault operators for operational
/// costs and risk management, (2) Performance Fees: Charged on excess returns above hurdle rates, aligning operator
/// incentives with user returns. The hurdle rate mechanism can operate in two modes: soft hurdle (fees on all profits)
/// or hard hurdle (fees only on excess above hurdle). Fee calculations integrate with the batch settlement system,
/// ensuring accurate deductions from user returns during share price calculations. Backend coordination allows for
/// off-chain fee processing with on-chain validation and tracking. All fees are expressed in basis points (1% = 100 bp)
/// for precision and standard financial terminology alignment.
