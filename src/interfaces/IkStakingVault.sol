/// @title IkStakingVault
/// @notice Comprehensive interface combining retail staking operations with ERC20 share tokens and vault state reading
/// @dev This interface aggregates all kStakingVault functionality by extending IVault (staking/batch/claims/fees) and
/// IVaultReader (state queries) while adding standard ERC20 operations for stkToken management. The interface provides
/// a complete view of vault capabilities: (1) Staking Operations: Full request/claim lifecycle for retail users,
/// (2) Batch Management: Lifecycle control for settlement periods, (3) Share Tokens: Standard ERC20 functionality for
/// stkTokens that accrue yield, (4) State Reading: Comprehensive vault metrics and calculations, (5) Fee Management:
/// Performance and management fee configuration. This unified interface enables complete vault interaction through a
/// single contract, simplifying integration for front-ends and external protocols while maintaining modularity through
/// interface composition. The combination of vault-specific operations with standard ERC20 compatibility ensures
/// stkTokens work seamlessly with existing DeFi infrastructure while providing specialized staking functionality.
